How to run this project in your Computer:

To run this project in your Computer please replace a 
file which is given in the models folder "rohit.txt" from the "flight_rf.pkl" file which link is given below:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/14AV6nMrcozEJQQxCK57q5FD_mhgEURgB/view?usp=drivesdk

I have done such because flight_rf.pkl file is large file which can not upload on the github.
so sorry for this.
